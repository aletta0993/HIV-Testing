            <p>This visualization intends to answer the question of which groups of people are more likely to reject HIV testing today. The first horizontal bar represents the outcome variable, and the underlying bars are the predictors. By dragging each predictor dimension up, we are able to see the relative proportion of people who rejected HIV testing to people who accepted HIV testing in each category. When we hover over each path, we see the absolute count of people in the category as well as the percentage relative to the <strong>entire</strong> sample.</p>
            <p>People who identified themselves as at least somewhat religious were much more likely to reject HIV testing. 22% (vs. 55% accepted) rejected testing today if they were at least somewhat religious, whereas only 1% (vs. 24% accepted) rejected if they were at most not very religious.</p>
            <p>People who had accepted HIV testing last year were much more likely to reject HIV testing today. Dragging the <em>HIV Tested Last Year</em> bar to the second row, 15% (vs. 73% accepted) rejected testing if they rejected last year as well, whereas 8% (vs. 4% accepted) rejected if they accepted last year. </p>
